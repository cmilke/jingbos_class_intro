This series of programs is made to help introduce students to the terrifying world of ROOT and Geant4.
Each tutorial is self contained, and is not dependent on code from any of the others (the tutorials do of course depend on ROOT and Geant4).

For the most part, each program builds off the next.
For example, to create tutorial02 I just copied all of tutorial01 and then added a few more things to it.
The goal is to (hopefully) add complexity slowly enough that students never get overwhelmed with too many new parts at once.

Below is a description of what concept each tutorial is meant to introduce:

00 - An introduction to ROOT histograms
    Here students can familiarize themselves with the interactive ROOT interpreter,
    the layout of the ROOT GUI, and experiment with the different types of ROOT histograms.

01 - An introduction to ROOT trees
    This introduces compiled ROOT programs, the concept of a ROOT Tree & Branches,
    and shows how to output and read Trees.

02 - A brief look at automating plot generation with ROOT
    This final tutorial on ROOT shows a portion of ROOT's many options for
    customizing the appearance of plots autonomously
