When compiled and run, rootTree.cc will generate a ROOT tree containing two branches,
then output this tree to a root file.

When run interactively through ROOT, tree_reader.cxx will reed the output root file,
iterate through its branches, and plot the data contained within on a two-dimensional
histogram.
